# Telegram Forwarder Bot (Multi-User)
This bot works by acting as you. Login with your number, set source/dest, and forward messages from your account. No terminal work needed.

Commands:
- /login
- /setsource
- /setdest
- /startforward
- /stopforward

If login fails, try again after 5 seconds.

---

Ab sab set ho gaya. `start.sh` se full bot start hota hai, aur har user apne number se login kar sakta hai bot ke through. Kya isme image ya code filters bhi add karne hain aage?
